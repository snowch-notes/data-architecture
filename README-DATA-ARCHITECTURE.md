# Introduction

This is a living document of typical [non-functional requirement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) (NFR) questions for data intensive analytic architectures.

Data intensive analytic architectures are typically 'fed' with data from other systems such as OLTP systems.  The main data flow patterns for these architectures are:

Analytic solution architectures are typically not the masters of the data they hold.  If data has incorrect values, it is usually updated in the upstream source system and these updates then trickle through to the analytics solution.

## Ingest

**Introduction**

This section is to provide insight into the data ingest patterns to design the data ingest process.

**Questions**

 - How will the data arrive?
   - As a continuous *stream* of data?
      - What is the peak rate of ingest in Gb/s? Now, 1YR, 3YRs, 5YRs? 
      - What is the peak rate of ingest in records/second? Now, 1YR, 3YRs, 5YRs?
      - What does the load curve look like?  E.g. is it fairly flat and consistent, or does it vary a lot?
      - What are the required delivery guarantees (exactly once, at most once, at least once)?  Hint: do downstream queries on landed data need to be 100% accurate?
   - As periodic *batches* of data?
      - What frequency?
      - What is specification for the batch data?
      - What are the file sizes?
         - Row count?
         - Size on disk?
         - How are the sizes expected to grow/shrink over time?
 - Will the ingest grow or decrease in volumes over time?
 - How are records identified?
   - How are the records distributed around the identifier?  Is there any skew?
 - What is considered late data? E.g. a shop loses network connectivity for a day due to a fault - how do we handle the late point-of-sales transactions?
 - When does the data load start arriving?
    - Do we need to back-load data prior to this (e.g. by batch load)?
      - How much data needs to be back-loaded in Gb?
      - How much data needs to be back-loaded in record counts?
 - After receiving the data how quickly should clients be able to see the data in queries (latency)?
 - Is the data structured or unstructued?
 - What is the data format/encoding?  E.g. avro, json, csv, parquet, xls
 - If structured, can you share a sample of data?
 - If structured, can you share a schema for the data?
 - If file based, can you share a specification and files?
 - Can you provide some context for this source of data?  E.g. 
    - Where is the data coming from?
    - How is it generated?
 - Who is/will be the master of the data? E.g.
    - Is it a source relational database that we are performing change data capture from?
    - Is *this* system that we are building going to be the master?
    - How can we detect incremental changes in the source system? E.g.
      - Specialised off the shelf change data capture tools such as [InfoSphere CDC](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSX3HK_6.5.2/com.ibm.cdcdoc.mcadminguide.doc/concepts/overview_of_cdc.html)
      - Manually select changes based on timestamp or row versioning in RDBMS? [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture)
      - Monitor filesystem folder for new files
 - How is the data model expected to change over time?  I.e. do we need to use a format that is resistent to schema changes (such as avro)?
 - How can you verify that you have not ingested dirty (incorrect) data?
 - How can you verify that you have ingested all the required data?  E.g. 
   - Weekly row counts of records ingested cross-related to number of inserts/updates in source system
 - Who will build and maintain the data ingest process?
   - What are their core skills?
   - Will they be trained to provide necessary skills?
 - What is your development lifecycle, or are you flexible? e.g. [pause and resume with savepoints](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/setup/savepoints.html#overview)
 - Who will monitor the streams? 
 - What do they want to monitor?  [Flink example](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/monitoring/checkpoint_monitoring.html), [IBM Streaming Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/07/streaming-analytics-metrics-using-rest-api/)

## Predict

    - Existing model?
       - How was the model created?
          - Libraries/frameworks?  
          - Versions?
          - How big is the model, how much memory space does it take?
    - Create a new one?
       - Do you have a preferences on libraries/frameworks to use?
 - How frequently will the model be refreshed?
 - How will it be refreshed? manually? automatically?
 - What is the business purpose of the model?
 - How is the business success of the model measured?  E.g. profit generated
 - Is the problem domain perceptual and requiring deep learning? E.g. working with audio, image, video
 - What is the type of problem?  E.g. regression, classification, collaborative filtering, ...
 - Is the prediction task batch or near real-time? 
 - Now ask the ingest questions for each batch/stream of data for prediction.

## Analyse (realtime)

 - Completeness: How important is it to have all of your data before you compute your result?
 - Latency: How long do you want to wait for data? For example, do you wait until you think you have all data? Do you process data as it arrives?
 - Cost: How much compute power/money are you willing to spend to lower the latency?
